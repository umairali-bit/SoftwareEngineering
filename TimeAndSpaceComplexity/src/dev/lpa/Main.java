/*
why time complexity matters - it tells how fast or slow an algorithm runs on the size of input
- it also measures efficiency.

O(1), O(n), O(n2), O(logn), O(nlogn), O(2n), O(n2)

O stands for big-O notation -> language of time complexity, n is the size of the input.

we focus on worst case scenarios, ignore constants, focus on only high order items.

O(n) -> its like a airport security. The more people there are, the more time it will take
O(n2)-> comparing everyone to everyone.
