# Introduction to Spring & Spring Boot

Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring Framework. The Spring Framework was first introduced in 2003 by Rod Johnson as a solution to the complexity of Java Enterprise Edition (JEE), which required extensive configuration before writing business logic. These configurations involved setting up servers, databases, logging, and more.

The Spring Framework introduced the Inversion of Control (IoC) container to manage such configurations. Initially, configuration was done using XML, which still required significant setup.

In 2009, Spring was sold to VMware. By 2014, VMware introduced **Spring Boot**, a streamlined, production-ready version of Spring with auto-configurations and pre-built dependencies, allowing developers to focus on business logic right away.

## Spring Framework

- **Spring** is a dependency injection framework that promotes loose coupling in Java applications.
- It simplifies the development of Java EE applications.
- Enables development using **Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs)** with enterprise-level features applied non-invasively.

### Key Components
- Core Container  
- AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)  
- JDBC  
- Web  
- Testing  

---

## IoC Container

The **IoC Container** in Spring is responsible for:

- Creating and managing **beans** (Java objects)
- Injecting **dependencies** into those beans
- Managing their lifecycle

### Responsibilities

- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Injecting dependencies into beans during initialization.
- **Event-Driven Programming (EDP):** Handling events and listeners.
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):** Adding cross-cutting concerns like logging or security.

### Types of Configuration

- **XML-based**
- **Annotation-based**
- **Java-based**

## Gradle, Maven, and Artifact

Spring projects typically use **Gradle** or **Maven** as build automation tools to manage:

- Project dependencies
- Builds
- Testing
- Packaging

### Artifact
An artifact is the final build output (e.g., `myapp.jar`). It also defines the application name, base directory, main class, and possibly the package structure.

Maven artifacts follow this coordinate structure:  
`groupId:artifactId:version`

## Gradle vs Maven

| Feature               | Maven                          | Gradle                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Language              | XML (`pom.xml`)               | Groovy/Kotlin DSL (`build.gradle`)          |
| Performance           | Slower due to XML parsing      | Faster with incremental builds & daemons    |
| Popularity            | Mature and widely adopted      | Newer but increasingly popular              |
| Configuration Style   | Convention-based (rigid)       | Script-based (flexible)                     |
| Dependency Management | Centralized                    | Flexible with support for Maven Central     |

## Beans in Spring

- Beans are core components of a Spring application.
- Managed by the IoC container.
- Their lifecycle includes creation, dependency injection, initialization, usage, and destruction.

---

## Spring Annotations

Spring annotations offer a modern, Java-based way to configure beans without relying on verbose XML files.

### Common Annotations
- `@Component`
- `@Service`
- `@Repository`
- `@Controller`
- `@SpringBootApplication`

---

## Defining Beans

1. **Stereotype Annotations**  
   Annotate your class with `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, or `@Controller`.  
   - `@SpringBootApplication` is the main entry point for Spring Boot apps.

2. **Configuration Class**  
   - Annotate the class with `@Configuration`.
   - Define beans manually using `@Bean` annotated methods.

---

## Bean Lifecycle

1. **Creation** â€“ Instance is created by the IoC container.  
2. **Dependency Injection** â€“ Dependencies are injected via constructor, field, or setter.  
3. **Initialization** â€“ Spring invokes initialization methods like those annotated with `@PostConstruct`.  
4. **Usage** â€“ The bean is available for use in the application.  
5. **Destruction** â€“ Spring calls `@PreDestroy` methods when shutting down.

---

## Bean Lifecycle Hooks

- `@PostConstruct`: Called immediately after dependency injection.
- `@PreDestroy`: Called just before the bean is removed from the container.

---

## Bean Scopes

Beans are stored in heap memory.

| Scope     | Description                                                                                       |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Singleton | (Default) A single instance per Spring IoC container.                                              |
| Prototype | A new instance is created each time the bean is requested.                                        |
| Request   | One bean instance per HTTP request (Web-aware context only).                                      |
| WebSocket | One bean instance per WebSocket lifecycle (Web-aware context only).                               |

## Dependency Injection (DI)

### Smoothie Analogy ðŸ§ƒ

**Without DI:**  
You (the class) go shopping for ingredients (dependencies) yourself.  
- Tightly coupled  
- Harder to change or test

**With DI:**  
Ingredients are provided to you.  
- Loosely coupled  
- Easier to manage and test

### Why Use DI?

- **Loose Coupling**: Components are independent and maintainable  
- **Flexibility**: Swap dependencies easily  
- **Testability**: Mock dependencies during unit testing

### DI Methods

1. **Constructor Injection**  
   - Dependencies passed via constructor  
   - Promotes immutability and testability  

2. **Field Injection**  
   - Uses `@Autowired` to inject directly into fields

## Spring Boot vs Spring Framework

| Feature                       | Spring Framework | Spring Boot                              |
|------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Dependencies Management      | Manual           | Uses pre-configured starter dependencies |
| Configuration                | Manual           | Auto-configuration out of the box        |
| Server Setup                 | External         | Embedded Tomcat, Jetty, etc.             |
| Health & Metrics             | Manual           | Built-in Actuator support                |
| External Configuration Files | Limited          | Flexible via `.properties`, `.yaml`, etc.|

---

## `pom.xml` in Spring Boot

- Spring Boot uses **Maven** to manage dependencies defined in `pom.xml`.
- The `spring-boot-starter-parent` includes default libraries and configurations.
- Spring Boot uses `spring-boot-dependencies` for managing library versions via `dependencyManagement`.

---

## What is Auto-Configuration?

**Auto-configuration** automatically configures Spring applications based on the dependencies on the classpath and application properties.

### How It Works

1. **Classpath Scanning**  
   Spring Boot looks for classes/libraries in the classpath and applies configuration accordingly.

2. **Configuration Classes**  
   Spring Boot includes predefined configuration classes for common components (DataSource, JPA, etc.).

3. **Conditional Beans**  
   Spring uses annotations like `@ConditionalOnClass`, `@ConditionalOnBean`, `@ConditionalOnProperty` to apply configurations selectively.

### Example Conditional Annotations

- `@ConditionalOnClass(DataSource.class)` â€“ Only configure if the class is present  
- `@ConditionalOnBean(DataSource.class)` â€“ Only configure if a bean exists  
- `@ConditionalOnProperty("my.property")` â€“ Only configure if property is set

---

## Auto-Configuration Features

- **@PropertySources**: Automatically loads common property sources.  
- **META-INF**: The magic of auto-configuration is powered by `spring-boot-autoconfigure` JAR.  
- **Enhanced Conditional Support**: Spring Boot extends the conditional system to cover common patterns.

---

## Spring Boot Internal Flow

1. **Initialization**  
   Application starts from a class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`.

2. **Component Scanning**  
   Automatically detects and loads components, beans, and configurations.

3. **Auto-Configuration**  
   Applies default settings for available libraries on the classpath.

4. **External Configuration**  
   Loads `.properties`, `.yaml`, environment variables, or CLI arguments.

5. **Embedded Server**  
   Launches a pre-configured web server (e.g., Tomcat).

6. **Lifecycle Callbacks**  
   Executes `@PostConstruct` methods and initialization logic.

7. **Application Ready**  
   App is fully initialized and ready to handle requests.
